General Idea: In 2017 and 2018 Congress set funds asside for Opportunity Zones, these are funds they would give to states to insentivise, often with taxes, investments into areas distressed aeas of America. The purpose is to instigate economic growth and job creation in these distressed communities, while offering tax insentives to investors. Governor John Carney slected 25 Opportunity Zones accross three counties in Delaware in 2018. Delaware's Opportinity Zone information is available on Open Data Delaware. 

Null hypothesis: Unemployment has increased or stayed the same since 2018 in the majority of Opportunity Zones in Delaware.

Alternative hypothesis: Unemployment has decreased since 2018 in the majority of Opportunity Zones in Delaware.

/#Defining "majority" Because areas labeled as Opportunity Zones range from rural, to suburban, to urban areas, some with larger capacity for job growth than others, and it has only been four years we will be looking at the majority of these zones. We are defining majority as more than half and will round down to 12.
/# Defining "unemployment" as those who are jobless and actively seeking work
/# Because in 2020 the COVID-19 greatly affected emplyment, especially for those with low job security, its affect on this data must be considered. Although the pandemic could not have been forseen by legislatures in 2017/18, investments into these communities have never been more necessary. The Delaware Opportunity Zones were only designated in April of 2018, a year before March of 2019, when the state effectively shut down. Seeing any change in unemployment within that time and analyzing the data since the state largely opened may be possible.
