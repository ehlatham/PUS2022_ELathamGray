This homework was, for me, about continueing to learn coding. I'm understanding more every time I try. For instance my errors no longer say "Syntax" as much. I still have a long way to go.
I worked alone. I have plans going forward to work with someone. I used your videos, google, and the book you linked. 
I was responsible for all of it.
I left notes on the parts of the assighnment I couldn't nail down. I understand if I'll be docked points for them being incorrect. I did what I could and wanted to note what walls I was running into so I can keep track to learn how to overcome them. 
I also saved it both ways to GitHub neither look right. I can view on GitHub and then I can upload, but HW3 the file I created never shows up as an option.
